# Coding-Skills
My Name is Robert Ongaba, I am  a computer Scientist, I love coding as it makes my brain active all the time and I love helping non coders learn how to code the simplest way. I own a couple of online web developer sites where I help many companies / students or just anyone interested in coding.
